# Visualization of Patient Risk‚ÄìBenefit Space

This Jupyter notebook allows you to visualize **risk, benefit, or adverse events data** for **monotherapy** and **combination therapy** using **forest plots**.  


## Purpose
- Display point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for each therapy group.  
- Compare different therapies across multiple benefits or adverse events.  
- Provide a flexible and interactive way to explore your dataset.  


## Input Data
- Excel file with two sheets for therapy groups (names can be adjusted):  
  - One sheet for **monotherapy** (e.g., `"Benefit mono"`)  
  - One sheet for **combination therapy** (e.g., `"Benefit combo"`)  

- Each sheet must contain at least the following columns:  
  - First column: x-axis labels (either Benefits or Adverse Events or Risks)  
  - `point estimate` ‚Üí y-axis value  
  - `95% CI-left` and `95% CI-right` ‚Üí 95% confidence intervals  
  - Other columns (e.g., number of studies, patients, I-square, model) are optional.  


## Instructions
1. Update the `file_path` variable to point to your Excel file.  
2. Adjust sheet names in `therapy_sheets` if needed.  
3. Run all cells in the notebook to generate the forest plot.  
4. Optionally, uncomment the `plt.savefig` line to save the figure as a PNG file.  


## Notes
- The x-axis is automatically set based on the first column of each sheet.  
- Colors indicate therapy groups:  
  - üî¥ Red = Monotherapy  
  - üîµ Blue = Combination therapy  
- Optional y-tick removal is included to avoid overlapping labels (e.g., `"SD"` as Stable Disease).  
  Adjust or remove this option depending on your dataset.
